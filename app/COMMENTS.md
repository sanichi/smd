Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 20 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in /Users/mjo/Projects/app/smd

I'll analyze this codebase to understand the build system, code style, and testing approach, then create an AGENTS.md file for agentic coding agents.

Now I'll create the AGENTS.md file based on my analysis of this Rails codebase:

I've created an AGENTS.md file for this Rails codebase. The file provides essential information for agentic coding agents working in this repository, including:

**Build/Test Commands:** How to run the full test suite, individual specs, tagged tests, and development server using the standard Rails/RSpec conventions.

**Code Style Guidelines:** Key patterns I identified from analyzing the codebase:
- HAML views with I18n
- CanCanCan authorization pattern
- Concerns for shared model functionality  
- Bootstrap 5 styling
- Strong validation patterns with custom messages
- Proper error handling and resource cleanup
- Standard Rails naming conventions

The file is concise (~20 lines) and focuses on the most important information an agent would need to understand this codebase's conventions and tooling.

Have you any comments on or criticisms of this project?

Looking at this Rails codebase, I have several observations:

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured Rails app following conventions
- Good use of concerns (Constrainable, Pageable) for shared functionality
- Comprehensive validation with custom error messages
- Proper authorization with CanCanCan
- Good test coverage with RSpec and Capybara
- Clean separation of concerns in the MVC pattern

**Areas for improvement:**

**Security & Code Quality:**
- The `run` method in `painting.rb:226` uses dangerous shell execution with `%x|#{cmd} 2>&1|` - this could be vulnerable to command injection
- Image processing logic is complex and tightly coupled - consider using a gem like ImageProcessing or MiniMagick
- Hard-coded constants like `IMAGE_MAX = 900` should be configurable

**Architecture:**
- The `Painting` model is doing too much - image processing, file manipulation, and business logic. This violates single responsibility
- The `move_images` method has error handling but logs to the wrong logger (`Rails.loggger` typo on line 220)
- Complex SQL in scopes like `by_size` could be extracted to database views or methods

**Modern Rails practices:**
- Using Rails 8 but still has some older patterns
- Could benefit from Active Storage for file handling instead of custom image processing
- The search method is quite complex and could be refactored using scopes or a search object

**Testing:**
- Good test structure but could use more unit tests for the complex image processing logic
- The `test_image` helper is well-designed for handling different file types

Overall, it's a solid Rails application that works well but could benefit from refactoring the image processing concerns and addressing the security issue with shell command execution.
